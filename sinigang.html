    <h4>How to cook:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Begin by using the water from when you washed your rice and pour this into the pot together with the onions and tomatoes. Bring this to a simmer for about 8 minutes.</li>
        <li>Throw in the shrimp, long green chilli, radish, eggplant and okra and let this simmer until cooked through. Make sure that you have removed the black veins from the back of the shrimp with the help of a sharp pairing knife and that you have washed the head in cold running water because this is where the shrimp feces comes out.</li>
        <li>Long beans, kangkong stalks and leaves are added at the last minute before pouring in the Knorr Sinigang sa Sampalok Mix Original. Give this a gentle stir and allow to simmer for a few minutes. If you want more of that “asim kilig” goodness, try using 1 (40g) pack of Knorr Sinigang sa Sampalok Mix Original.</li>
        <li>With a bowl of patis and calamansi, and steaming hot rice, what more can your family ask for.</li>
    </ol>
